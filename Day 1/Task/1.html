    <!-- Main heading of the article -->
    <h1>The Structure of Quantum Particles</h1>

    <!-- Abstract Section -->
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        In this article, we explore the structure of <b>quantum particles</b>, focusing on the interactions between subatomic particles and their roles in 
        the formation of <mark>matter</mark>. The primary goal of this study is to understand the behavior of particles at a quantum level and how this behavior 
        contributes to the <i>fundamental laws of physics</i>.
    </p>

    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of particles on an atomic and subatomic scale. At the core of quantum 
        mechanics is the concept of a <u>wave-particle duality</u>, where particles exhibit properties of both <i>waves</i> and <i>particles</i>. This duality 
        forms the foundation of <abbr title="Quantum Field Theory">QFT</abbr>, which seeks to explain the interactions between particles in different fields.
    </p>

    <!-- The Particle Structure Section -->
    <h3>Quantum Particle Structure</h3>
    <p>
        The structure of quantum particles can be understood by studying their interaction with <mark>electromagnetic</mark> fields. Particles such as electrons 
        have a charge that interacts with the fields, leading to the formation of matter. The energy of the particle can be calculated using the formula 
        <b>E = mc<sup>2</sup></b>, where <i>E</i> is the energy, <i>m</i> is the mass, and <i>c</i> is the speed of light.
    </p>

    <!-- The Role of Subatomic Particles -->
    <h3>Subatomic Particles</h3>
    <p>
        Subatomic particles, including <abbr title="Proton Neutron Electron">PNE</abbr> combinations, play a critical role in the formation of the atom. 
        Electrons, represented as <i>negative charges</i>, orbit the nucleus formed by protons and neutrons. These interactions are governed by the principles 
        of <u>quantum mechanics</u>, which dictates the probabilistic nature of electron positioning.
    </p>

    <!-- Superscripts and Subscripts in Scientific Notation -->
    <h4>Scientific Notations</h4>
    <p>
        Chemical formulas also play an important role in quantum theory. For example, the formula for water is H<sub>2</sub>O, which represents two hydrogen 
        atoms and one oxygen atom. Additionally, isotopic notation involves superscripts and subscripts, such as in <sup>14</sup>C for carbon-14.
    </p>

    <!-- Quantum State and Measurement -->
    <h4>Quantum State and Measurement</h4>
    <p>
        In quantum mechanics, the <mark>quantum state</mark> of a particle refers to its state of existence at any given point in time. This can be measured 
        using a set of observables, each of which provides different information about the particle's properties. A common challenge in this area is the 
        <i>Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle</i>, which states that it is impossible to simultaneously measure the exact position and momentum of a particle.
    </p>

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>
        The study of quantum particles reveals a complex but fascinating world. As we continue to explore the depths of <mark>quantum mechanics</mark>, new 
        insights into the fundamental forces of the universe will undoubtedly emerge, pushing the boundaries of our understanding.
